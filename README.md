Passionate about technology and innovation.
My learning is based on creating projects and impacting people's lives through lines of code.

"Nothing in this world beats good old-fashioned persistence. Talent does not overcome. Nothing is more common than talented failures. Genius doesn't overcome. Unrecognized Geniuses is practically a clich√©. Education does not. Because the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are powerful"
